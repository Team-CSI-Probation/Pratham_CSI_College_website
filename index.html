  <br><br>

  <br><br>
  <p>
    Madan Mohan Malaviya (About this soundpronunciation (help·info) (25 December 1861 – 12 November 1946) was an Indian
    scholar, educational reformer and politician notable for his role in the Indian independence movement, as the three
    times president of Indian National Congress and the founder of Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha. He was respectfully
    addressed by the title Pandit[1] and also addressed as Mahamana.

    Malaviya strived to promote modern education among Indians and eventually co-founded the Banaras Hindu University
    (BHU) at Varanasi in 1916, which was created under the B.H.U. Act, 1915. It is the largest residential university in
    Asia and one of the largest in the world,[3] having over 40,000 students across arts, commerce, sciences,
    engineering, linguistic, Ritual, medicine, agriculture, performing arts, law and technology from all over the world.
    He was the vice chancellor of the Banaras Hindu University from 1919 to 1938.

    Malaviya was one of the founders of the Bharat Scouts and Guides.[6] He also founded a highly influential, English
    newspaper, The Leader published from Allahabad in 1909.[7] He was also the Chairman of Hindustan Times from 1924 to
    1946. His efforts resulted in the launch of its Hindi edition named Hindustan Dainik in 1936.

    He was posthumously conferred with the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, on 24 December 2014, one day
    before his 153rd birth anniversary.

  <h1>Achievements</h1>
  <br>
  <h2> Padma Shri (1977)</h2>
  <br>
  <img src="./a1.jpg" alt="Padma Shri (1977)">
  <p> Padma Awards were instituted in 1954 to be awarded to citizens of India in recognition of their distinguished
    contribution in various spheres of activity including the arts, education, industry, literature, science, sports,
    medicine, social service and public affairs. It has also been awarded to some distinguished individuals who were not
    citizens of India but did contribute in various ways to India.

    The selection criteria have been criticised in some quarters with the claim that many highly deserving artists have
    been left out in order to favour certain individuals.[2][3] India has now created an online nomination platform for
    the common citizens to recommend the nomination for the annually given civilian "Padma" awards.[4]

    On its obverse, the words "Padma", meaning lotus in Sanskrit, and "Shri", a Sanskrit-derived honorific equivalent to
    'Mr.' or 'Ms.' (i.e., "Noble One in Blossom"), appear in Devanagari above and below a lotus flower. The geometrical
    pattern on either side is in burnished bronze. All embossing is in white gold.</p>

  <br>
  <img src="./a2.jpg" alt="Padma Vibhushan (2012) ">
  <p>The Padma Vibhushan ("Lotus Decoration") is the second-highest civilian award of the Republic of India, after the
    Bharat Ratna. Instituted on 2 January 1954, the award is given for "exceptional and distinguished service". All
    persons without distinction of race, occupation, position or sex are eligible for these awards. However, government
    servants including those working with PSUs, except doctors and scientists, are not eligible for these Awards. As of
    2020, the award has been bestowed on 314 individuals, including seventeen posthumous and twenty-one non-citizen
    recipients.

    During 1 May and 15 September of every year, the recommendations for the award are submitted to the Padma Awards
    Committee, constituted by the Prime Minister of India. The recommendations are received from all the state and the
    union territory governments, the Ministries of the Government of India, the Bharat Ratna and previous Padma
    Vibhushan award recipients, the Institutes of Excellence, the Ministers, the Chief Ministers and the Governors of
    State, and the Members of Parliament including private individuals. The committee later submits their
    recommendations to the Prime Minister and the President of India for the further approval. The award recipients are
    announced on Republic Day.</p>

  <img src="./a3.jpg" alt="Dadasaheb Phalke Award (1992)">
  <p>The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is India's highest award in the field of cinema. It is presented annually at the
    National Film Awards ceremony by the Directorate of Film Festivals, an organisation set up by the Ministry of
    Information and Broadcasting. The recipient is honoured for their "outstanding contribution to the growth and
    development of Indian cinema"[1] and is selected by a committee consisting of eminent personalities from the Indian
    film industry.[2] The award comprises a Swarna Kamal (Golden Lotus) medallion, a shawl, and a cash prize of
    ₹1,000,000 (US$13,000).[3]

    Presented first in 1969, the award was introduced by the Government of India to commemorate Dadasaheb Phalke's
    contribution to Indian cinema.[4] Phalke (1870–1944), who is popularly known as and often regarded as "the father of
    Indian cinema", was an Indian filmmaker who directed India's first full-length feature film, Raja Harishchandra </p>

  <p>The Padma Bhushan is the third-highest civilian award in the Republic of India, preceded by the Bharat Ratna and
    the Padma Vibhushan and followed by the Padma Shri. Instituted on 2 January 1954, the award is given for
    "distinguished service of a high order...without distinction of race, occupation, position or sex." The award

    of India for the further approval. The award recipients are announced on 26 January, the Republic Day of India.
